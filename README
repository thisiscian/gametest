Game Project
============

Boost
-----
Currently using boost program options, might switch to my own thing later (less dependencies)

GLFW
----
I've had a lot of luck with this
nice tutorial at: http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-1-opening-a-window/
but has old tokens, fixes of which exist at http://www.glfw.org/docs/3.0/moving.html#moving_renamed_tokens
